# Meetings
These can be found under `monthly-meetings`. Monthly meetings take place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XQfxBcHnJj) each Saturday at 19 UTC. It's pretty fun and relaxing, just some casual discussion about PLT and other technical things. Come say hi :wave:!

> TODO: move former meta stuff, like `brainstorming` out of this repo.
