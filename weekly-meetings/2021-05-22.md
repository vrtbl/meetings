## Topics of Discussion
Today was, well:

> It's going to be a casual, a 'what have you been working on / what are you working on' sort of deal; everyone's welcome to hop in and say hello!

This is the first meeting we've had after a while, so we were just getting back into the swing of things.

## Outline
### Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
- This is a fun little game, for more info as to how it works, you can google it.
- The best strategy is usually tit-for-tat, but there are ways we can get higher scores if we take advantage of non-optimal strategies.
- Isaac has been working on a strategy for a while now:
  - Uses omega tft to get out of defect wars or seesaws
  - Uses A-Pavlov to group opposing strategies into buckets and counter them
  - Uses online q-learning to build a model of the opponents strategy, which we can then exploit
  - Uses a genetic algorithm to optimize strategy hyperparsms
- > I remember seeing a “game” (which was more of an interactive essay) that this reminds me of, it was called “The Evolution of Trust”, I think. https://ncase.me/trust/

### Shaw's Browser
- Shaw is working on a little browser that supports Passerine as a scripting language. It looks really cool!
- SDLang instead of HTML/CSS
- Discussion of webassembly and sandboxing
  - using algebraic effects for an FFI system to ensure passerine is sandboxed

### Lisp Machines and FPGAs
- Brief discussion of FPGAs
- Isaac would like to implement a small lisp machine and run it on an FPGA
