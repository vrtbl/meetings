# Weekly Meeting on Year-Month-Day
This weekly meeting was attended by:

- @slightknack
- Shaw Summa (4984#4984)
- @siraben

These notes were taken by [Your Name](a-link-that-points-to-you).

## Topics of Discussion
Today we planned to discuss:
- The Type System
- Construction Patterns and Lenses
- Logo and site redesign
- Passerine Playground

## Outline
I forgot to write notes right after the meeting, so I forgot a bunch

### Construction Patterns
- Syntax: `update <construction pattern>`.
- Each item to update in the construction pattern is a function.
- We use `value` for constant values.

### NixOS Package
- @siraben tried to get Passerine working on NixOS but there was a packaging issue.
- We need to package `aspen`, and distribute that.

### General Discussion of Associated Namespaces on Labels
- A type has an associated namespace which can hold values and functions:
  - Do we use `impl` or just indexing to define it?

### Passerine Playground
- Short demo and explanation as to how it works

### Minivm and Fibonacci
- Shaw discussed compiling a lisp-like language to a fast VM in a single C file:
  - Beats `luajit --joff` on somebenchmarks.
  - Uses computed GOTOs.
  - Discussion of closures, etc.
  - Fat binary, uses cosmo.
