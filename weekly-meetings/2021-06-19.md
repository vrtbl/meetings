These notes were taken by [Isaac Clayton](https://slightknack.dev).

## Topics of Discussion
Today, we're going to be doing a couple of things:

- Going over the Readme, to revise and edit it for clarity and so on.
- Discussing recent changes in the compiler pipeline, including the new big-refactor branch
- and whatever else arises!

## Outline
In order of discussion, include each of the topics as a triple `###` sub-heading.

### Changes in the compiler pipeline
- the `big-refactor` branch is a huge change, making way for token-based macros
- currently, only the lexer works, but I'm working on the parser
- it's about +1.5k -2k atm
- api stability isn't exactly an issue at this point
- additionally, I have a history of huge changes and rewrites (see any `Tracking PR`)
- this branch being merged will mark `0.10.0` release

### FPGA and microvm hardware virtual machine
- I have a FPGA and I'm getting a new computer so I can program it.
- Shaw is gettin g

### Collatz and weird C stuff
Look at the following C:
```
int collatz(int n) {
    while (n != 0) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n = n / 2;
        }
        else {
            n = n * 3 + 1;
        }
    }
    return n;
}
```
This is some code that evaluates the [collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). What's supposed to happen is pretty simple; this code kinda functions like a truth machine. If the argument is zero, then the code should return zero, otherwise, it should loop forever.

But if we compile it on clang 12.0.0 with -O3, we get the following x86 output:
```
collaz:                                 # @collaz
        xor     eax, eax
        ret
```
it just returns zero.

if we change it to another condition, like `(n != 4)`, it will return 4. From my murky understanding, an infinite loop is undefined behaviour, so it's optimized away. Don't @ me.

This has to do with [hoare logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic#While_rule) for while loops.

In the same vein, any expression can be evaluated:
```
int main(int argc, char *argv[argc++]) {}
```
This is valid (see `argc++`). It makes sense; c is just whack. ;)

While we were on this subject, we talked about verifying c with Coq, and so on.

### Shaw's crazy type system
- Shaw is developing the VM paka, with the language purr
- he implemented a language server
- it's really fast, i.e. `fib(45)` na√Øve takes `5.1` seconds
  - wasm, has multiple backends (default vm, minivm, dlang, wasm, etc.)
- Well, what about the types?
- You can have dependant-ish types by passing types to functions, coolest form of metaprogramming.

TODO: expand on this!
