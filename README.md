Organizational structure and Governance of Passerine as a Language

## Weekly Meeting Notes
These can be found under `weekly-meetings`. Weekly meetings take place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XQfxBcHnJj) each Saturday at 15 UTC. It's pretty fun and relaxing, just some casual discussion about PLT and other technical things. Come say hi :wave:!

## Governance
Currently, governance is as follows:

- Core Team members (There are currently 4) oversee Working Groups.
- Contributers are people who have contributed in the past.
- A Contributer that the Core Team trusts may become a Core Team member.
- A Core Team members will periodically cycle out, but we don't have a process for this yet.

If you're interested in helping us develop a governance model, open an Issue or ping us on Discord. Here are the current working groups:

- Passerine Website and Devops Working Group (@rishiosaur?)
- Passerine Compiler Core Working Group (@slightknack)
- Passerine Tooling and Libraries Working Group (TBD)
