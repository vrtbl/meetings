# Weekly Meeting on Year-Month-Day
This weekly meeting was attended by:

- @slightknack
- @NeGate
- @02Keith
- @siraben

These notes were taken by [Isaac Clayton](https://slightknack.dev).

## Topics of Discussion
Today we planned to discuss:

- Algebraic effects, continuations, and concurrency
- Progress on `big-refactor` since last month
- Discussion over where types systems should end and macro systems begin
- An announcement about a project I'm planning to start developing in Passerine
- and a few other things...

## Outline
In order of discussion, include each of the topics as a triple `###` sub-heading.

### Limits for type systems and macro systems
- In a language with type-level programming, there is always a point where another level of abstraction is needed: https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/10871
- Macros get around this by putting the full power of the language at your disposal, can be hard to reason about though
- Where is the right point to draw the boundary?
  - Most tasks should not require macros to emulate type-level programming
  - But macros should not be so uncommon as to be unergonomic as a tool for using with types
  - I think the right line is at higher-kinded types

### Effective VM for Effects
- Effective is a small VM for algebraic effects modeled after passerine's that I plan to merge into passerine's eventually
- Implemented as dynamically scoped coroutines
  - other values can be dynamically scoped as well
  - coroutines are single shot delimited continuations
    - delimited continuations meaning they can not mangle the stack
    - single shot meaning they can only be resumed from a given point once
- https://github.com/slightknack/effective
- only about 300 loc: https://github.com/slightknack/effective/blob/master/src/vm.rs
- not fully featured by any means, more of an experiment than anything

### SKI Compilers and HKTs
- siraben brought up ben lynn's compiler, I brought up the Kind programming language
- blc is a haskell compiler that compiles to / is implemented via SKI, a simple rewriting rule. We've discussed this extensively in the past; this whole project is insane.

### Does O(n) really matter?
- We were talking about Shaw's VM and the design of the garbage collector
- Technically the design turns pointer dererences from an O(1) operation to an O(log_32(N)) operation (or something).
- In practice, O(n) doesn't really matter, as long as your code is cache-efficient and doesn't have any accidental N^2 blowups:
  - Funny blow-up:  https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/

### NaN-Tagging/Boxing
- NaN tagging is cramming pointers or other constant data types into the NaN of a standard floating-point double
- It's pretty cool, briefly went over Passerine's implementation, talked about pointer compaction in MiniVM

### Lua, MiniVM, and Cosmo
- Lua is a nice language because it is fairly small and has a smaller ISA (something like 35 register-based instructions: https://thesephist.com/posts/lua/)
- MiniVM can beat luajit (after warm-up with the JIT on!) in some benchmarks
- MiniVM used cosmo libc to compile cross-platform fat binaries: https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html
- "seems like an analogy could be made towards assembly instruction sets ala x86 vs arm/riscv" â€” keith
  - `x86:riscv::v8:lua` or something
  - tangent about M1 macs and perceived speedup

### Accel, GPUs, and Rust
- GPU programming is hard for a couple of reasons:
  - hard to debug: how do you print the stack traces for a million pixels?
    - there are tools to debug/step through individual pixels, which can be really useful for debugging â€” NeGate
  - hard to use for general purpose:
    - stuck with glsl/hlsl most of the time
    - aren't many langauges that compile to spir-v, nvcc can be a pain to use
- I did some work with GPUs this summer, implemented some crazy stuff with it:
  - https://github.com/tonarino/shadergarden
- Building on the last point for general-purpose gpu stuff:
  - https://docs.rs/accel/0.3.1/accel/ is pretty good
  - so is https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu 
  - problem is the bugginess of GPUs, in combination with the novelty of those projects, in combination with how hard it can be to debug gpus in general can make it really hard to know how to proceed.
- Transition into concurrency and parallelization in general

### Automatic Parallelization
- "Building a system which takes "normal" code and parallelizes  what it can is very interesting idea." â€” keith
- Discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the actor model:
  - rust actor model: https://github.com/tonarino/actor
  - in the context of the work I did past summer, for graphical pipelines, passing multiple frames through the pipeline at the same time using this crate
  - in the context of erlang, light-weight processes, spinning up thousands. How to schedule for something performance intensive like a pipeline?
  - Actor model isn't always dependent on the parellization model; for use we could use a thread per actor
    - things like tokio for automatic parellization are pretty cool
    - I've written down some of my thoughts here: https://slightknack.dev/passerine/schedule/

### Async and Effects and Wasm
- Async in rust can be a pain because it's infectious; well-designed, but because rust is low level it can be annoying to always bring in an evaluator context to evaluate async code in a sync context.
- Mentioned that I've done some work with async rust when it was very early on; implemented a clone of git hooked up to a web frontend that ran in wasm on the edge using cloudflare workers: https://website.slightknack.workers.dev/home / https://github.com/slightknack/website-2020
- Discussion of how async can be modeled using effects, how this is done in Koka
- talking about async in F#. Does it do it using effects? kinda, but no, uses computation expressions:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions
  - mention of how ocaml and f# are really similar, mentioned concurrency support in multicore ocaml: https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore
  - discussion of what multicore is and how it's going to be merged into main ocaml in the next release
  - " once upon a time f# had an ocaml mode ðŸ˜›" â€“ keith
- discussion of eff, the language  https://www.eff-lang.org/
  - mention of how oleg embedded eff in ocaml, parallel
  - Other languages brought up: koka, effekt, etc.

### Meta
- We discussed that it may be a good idea to record meetings in the future.
- I mentioned that I would be taking notes this session here. https://github.com/vrtbl/meta. (These are those notes!)
- It would be cool to turn this into a podcast or something, just a chill monthly discussion about programming language research
- That's about it. Also talked about college, cheesemaking, and the value of a master's work when aiming for a research role.
