# Meetings
These can be found under `monthly-meetings`. Monthly meetings take place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XQfxBcHnJj) each Saturday at 19 UTC. It's pretty fun and relaxing, just some casual discussion about PLT and other technical things. Hope to see you at the next one!

Past meetings (after 2022-02-05) have been recorded and are uploaded to youtube; links to the videos can be found in the notes for that day.
