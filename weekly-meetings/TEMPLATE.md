# Weekly Meeting on Year-Month-Day
This weekly meeting was attended by:

- List of github usernames
- Or discord tags, i.e. name#xxxx

These notes were taken by [Your Name](a-link-that-points-to-you).

## Topics of Discussion
Today we planned to discuss:

- list of general topics
- released before the meeting
- if it's a presentation by someone, include their github or discord username.

## Outline
In order of discussion, include each of the topics as a triple `###` sub-heading.

### An example
- Include links, general points, consensus on issues, etc.
- If there's a topic of discussion that is off-topic or personal, that's fine, you just don't have to take note of it
- If there is an additional topic that was not planned, just add a section and take notes as usual.
